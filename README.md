## Some Notes

I haven't actually used laravel in about 5 years, and it has changed a lot. I spent about 2 and half hours on this in total, and had some issues around remembering how to do a few bits, and had not used Sail before at all. I hope you take this into consideration, of course if I was more familiar with this framework, I would liked to have added in the nice to haves as well, but I was not going to spend more time than was expected just to impress, because it would have been un representative.
